1: Reflect back to when you first received news you were going to be a part of the BOOST Program. How did you feel? Was there anything you were really looking forward? Was there anything you were worried about? 

I had the flu when I received the news. Between naps, I checked my phone and saw a slack notification asking if I could hop into a quick zoom session for some good news. The message was sent four minutes prior, so I replied yes, stumbled to the bathroom to wash my face and try to look as put-together as I possibly could in that state. Upon hearing the news, I was elated and overwhelmed with excitement.

I returned to bed after the meeting still exhausted and unwell, but quite happy. There was a moment of trepidation where I worried about the path ahead and the responsibility that I'd just signed up for. "What have I gotten myself into?" was a thought that I had over and over, but it didn't dampen the excitement.

Think back to all of your projects, which one was your favorite? Why was it your favorite? What was your proudest moment with it? 

The first big Java project was definitely my favorite. It was the first time that I really felt in control when it came to writing my own programs. I was proud of how well I'd constructed my code, my seperation of concerns, and the creative solutions that I came up with for managing the data in the dictionary app.

Think back to all of your projects, which one was your least favorite? Why was it your least favorite? What was your proudest moment with it? 

The Capstone project was probably my least favorite. I didn't feel that we had enough instruction with React. The parameters for the project seemed poorly-defined and the instructions felt a bit rushed. I was very pleased with the back-end portion of the application, but I felt like we weren't given the foundation that we needed to work on the front-end portion.

Think about a moment that made you feel closer to your cohort members. What happened? What made you feel connected? Was there anything you wish you did to help connect more? 

Getting to meet in person made all the difference. On the first day, when we were all struggling in that conference room, trying to get our computers set up to begin our first day of classes, and then working through the first day of class and the subsequent homework, made me realize that we were all in this together, that we were all juts a little scared, and that we'd all work through it as a team.

Now that you are past the bootcamp, think of your last three months. How do you feel? Can you see the growth youâ€™ve accomplished? Go back to your first project on github and give yourself a code review. 

I'm very proud to have made it through the bootcamp, but I am well and truly exhausted. I certainly feel that I put unnecessary strain on myself beyond just the parameters of the bootcamp, but even still I would have been exhausted by the end of it. I am eager for a break to rest, recoup, and come back fresh.

I now know enough to cringe at my first project, which makes me proud of my progress, in a strange way.
